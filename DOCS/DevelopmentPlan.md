# HacktivateNations Arcade - Development Session Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Session Overview
We'll build this iteratively, starting with core infrastructure and progressively adding features. Each iteration will be a working, demonstrable piece.

## ðŸ“‹ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (M0 + Early M1)
**Goal**: Get the basic shell running with game module system

#### 1.1 Project Setup
- [x] Next.js 14 + TypeScript project structure
- [x] Basic folder architecture (`/src/games`, `/src/services`, `/src/components`)
- [x] ESLint/Prettier configuration
- [x] Basic Canvas rendering setup

#### 1.2 Game Module SDK
- [x] Define the `GameModule` interface from PRD
- [x] Create `Services` interfaces (InputManager, AudioManager, Analytics)
- [x] Build a simple game loader system
- [x] Create development helpers for game testing

#### 1.3 Basic Hub Shell
- [ ] Header with placeholder currency/level display
- [ ] Simple game carousel (no unlocking yet)
- [ ] Canvas container that can host games
- [ ] Basic routing between hub and game states

### Phase 2: First Game + Core Services (M1)
**Goal**: Have a playable runner game with working services

#### 2.1 Shared Services Implementation
- [ ] InputManager (keyboard, touch, gamepad abstraction)
- [ ] AudioManager (WebAudio context + global mixer)
- [ ] Basic Analytics hooks (PostHog or placeholder)

#### 2.2 Runner Game
- [ ] Simple endless runner mechanics
- [ ] Sprite rendering system
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Score system with currency generation
- [ ] Game over/restart flow

#### 2.3 Currency System Foundation
- [ ] Local storage for persistence
- [ ] Currency calculation: `floor(runScore/100) + pickups`
- [ ] Display in header with real-time updates

### Phase 3: Economy & Persistence (M2)
**Goal**: Add game unlocking and backend persistence

#### 3.1 Supabase Integration
- [ ] User authentication flow
- [ ] Database schema for users, games, progress
- [ ] Real-time currency sync
- [ ] Offline queue for actions

#### 3.2 Game Unlocking System
- [ ] Tier-based unlocking logic
- [ ] UI for locked games with cost display
- [ ] Purchase flow with confirmation
- [ ] Second game stub for testing

### Phase 4: Challenges & Engagement (M3)
**Goal**: Daily challenges and achievement system

#### 4.1 Challenge System
- [ ] Server-side challenge generation
- [ ] Daily quest UI panel
- [ ] Challenge progress tracking
- [ ] Completion rewards and multipliers

#### 4.2 Analytics & A/B Testing
- [ ] PostHog integration
- [ ] Feature flag system
- [ ] Funnel tracking implementation

### Phase 5: Polish & Performance (M4-M5)
**Goal**: PWA features, accessibility, and production readiness

#### 5.1 PWA & Offline
- [ ] Service worker with Workbox
- [ ] Add-to-home-screen prompts
- [ ] Offline game caching
- [ ] Background sync

#### 5.2 Accessibility & Polish
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Color-blind friendly palettes
- [ ] Performance optimization

## ðŸ›  Technical Decisions for Session

### Starting Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with app router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid iteration
- **State**: Zustand for game state management
- **Canvas**: Vanilla HTML5 Canvas (WebGL later)
- **Backend**: Start with localStorage, migrate to Supabase

### Development Approach
1. **Mobile-first**: Design for touch but ensure keyboard/mouse work
2. **Performance-conscious**: Keep bundle sizes small, lazy load games
3. **Iterative**: Each phase should be playable and testable
4. **Community-ready**: Structure code for easy game contributions

## ðŸŽ® First Game Choice: Endless Runner
Perfect starter because it:
- Demonstrates all core systems (input, rendering, audio, scoring)
- Simple enough to implement quickly
- Engaging enough to test retention
- Good foundation for currency earning mechanics

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics We'll Track
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 2.0s
- [ ] Game loads in < 500ms after selecting
- [ ] Smooth 60fps gameplay on mobile
- [ ] Currency system feels rewarding

## ðŸš€ Session Goals
By end of our session:
1. **Working prototype** with runner game playable
2. **Currency system** that feels engaging
3. **Clean architecture** for adding more games
4. **Performance baseline** meeting PRD targets
5. **Clear next steps** for community contributions
