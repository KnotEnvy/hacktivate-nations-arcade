# Test 101 - HacktivateNations Arcade Testing Suite

## 🎯 Current Testing Status

### **Coverage Summary**
- **Overall**: 30.47% services, 27.27% lib coverage (significantly improved!)
- **Unit Tests**: 7 test suites, 77 total tests (49 passing, 28 need fixes)
- **Integration/E2E**: Comprehensive plan created, ready for implementation

This repo uses Jest + ts-jest to test TypeScript modules with comprehensive mocking for Web Audio API, Canvas API, and localStorage. The test suite now covers critical services and foundational systems.

## 📋 What's Currently Tested

### **✅ Core Services (Well Covered)**
- **CurrencyService** (85% coverage): Reward calculation, add/spend behavior, storage, change listeners
- **AchievementService** (66% coverage): Unlocking logic by requirement and `gameId` filtering  
- **GameLoader** (84% coverage): Registration, discovery, graceful handling of unknown IDs
- **UserServices** (87% coverage): Profile management, experience/leveling, stats tracking
- **Analytics** (59% coverage): Session tracking, player insights, metrics calculation

### **✅ New Systems (100% Covered)**
- **GameThemes** (100% coverage): All 5 themes validated (colors, fonts, effects, animations)
- **Constants** (100% coverage): Economy settings, configuration values

### **⚠️ Partially Tested**
- **AudioManager** (10% coverage): Basic mocking setup, needs implementation alignment
- **BaseGame** (0% coverage): Complex game engine logic (intentionally deferred)

### **❌ Not Yet Tested**
- **React Components**: Excluded from unit tests (will be covered by E2E)
- **Hooks**: useCanvas, useGameModule, useInput (complex DOM integration)
- **Game Engines**: Individual games (RunnerGame, SnakeGame, etc.)
- **Stores**: Zustand state management
- **ChallengeService & InputManager**: Lower priority services

## 🧪 Test Infrastructure

### **Current Setup**
```bash
# Installed Dependencies
jest@30.1.3
ts-jest@29.4.1
@testing-library/jest-dom@6.8.0
@testing-library/react@16.3.0
jest-environment-jsdom@30.1.2
```

### **Key Configuration Files**
- `jest.config.js` – ts-jest preset, jsdom env, `@/*` alias mapping, coverage exclusions
- `jest.setup.ts` – Enhanced with Web Audio API mocks, Canvas API mocks, localStorage cleanup

### **Current Test Files**
```

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### **Basic Commands**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- AudioManager.test.ts

# Silent mode (less output)
npm test -- --silent
```

### **Coverage Targets**
```bash
# Current exclusions (in jest.config.js):
- src/app/**/*           # Next.js app directory
- src/components/**/*    # React components (E2E will handle)
- src/**/index.ts        # Barrel exports
- src/**/*.d.ts          # Type definitions
```

## 🎮 E2E Testing Strategy (Ready to Implement)

### **Framework Choice: Playwright**
```bash
# Installation commands ready:
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/playwright
npm install --save-dev lighthouse-ci
```

### **Critical E2E Test Suites Planned**
1. **Theme System Testing**: Verify all 5 games load correct themes (Neon Sprint, Retro Arcade, etc.)
2. **Game Play Flows**: Complete user journeys from game selection → play → coin earning
3. **Mobile Responsive**: Tab navigation, touch controls, viewport adaptations
4. **Audio Integration**: Settings modal, volume controls, mute functionality
5. **Achievement/Challenge**: Notification system, progression tracking
6. **Performance**: Lighthouse audits, accessibility compliance

### **Test Data Strategy**
- data-testid attributes following convention: `<component>-<element>-<identifier>`
- Isolated test environments with clean localStorage per test
- Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile testing: iOS Safari, Android Chrome

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### **Adding Unit Tests**
- **Target**: Services, utilities, pure logic functions
- **Approach**: Mock browser APIs (AudioContext, Canvas, localStorage)
- **Coverage Goal**: 80% for critical business logic
- **Performance**: Keep tests fast (<5s total runtime)

### **Mock Patterns**
```typescript
// Web Audio API (already configured)
global.AudioContext = jest.fn(() => mockAudioContext);

// Canvas API (already configured) 
HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext = jest.fn(() => mockCanvasContext);

// localStorage (auto-cleared between tests)
beforeEach(() => localStorage.clear());
```

### **Test Organization**
```typescript
describe('ServiceName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  describe('feature group', () => {
    test('specific behavior', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## 📊 Known Issues & Next Steps

### **Immediate Fixes Needed**
1. **AudioManager Tests**: Align mocks with actual implementation
2. **UserServices**: Fix onLevelUp method or adjust test expectations  
3. **Analytics**: Some async behavior timing issues

### **Phase 1 Priorities**
- [ ] Fix failing unit tests (AudioManager, UserServices)
- [ ] Add ChallengeService and InputManager tests
- [ ] Set up Playwright E2E framework
- [ ] Implement core game play journey tests

### **Phase 2 Expansion**
- [ ] Component testing with React Testing Library
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Cross-browser E2E test matrix

### **Phase 3 Advanced**
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users
- [ ] A11y automated testing with axe-core
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration
- [ ] Test data management and fixtures
